This project will concentrate on studying the scaled sound pressure, given the attributes in the dataset “Airfoil Self-Noise” provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This
dataset contains 1503 data points. We will determine the outliers in the datasets. Then, we will investigate whether the scaled sound pressure level can be predicted by the possible predictors
and the relationship between the scaled sound pressure level and the predictors. Finally, we will try to predict the scaled sound pressure level using our model.
