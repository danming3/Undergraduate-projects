In this project, we analyzed and visualized the 2020 presidential election dataset. We primarily worked towards building state/county-level red/blue map plots that are commonly shown on media coverage or google search. 

In addition, we combined the Untied States county-level census data with the election data. Then we built and selected classification models (among many predictive models that we have learned in class) to predict the election winner.
